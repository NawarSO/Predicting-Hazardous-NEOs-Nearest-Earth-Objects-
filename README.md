# Predicting-Hazardous-NEOs-Nearest-Earth-Objects-
This is a real-world dataset that tracks Nearest Earth Objects (NEOs) observed by NASA from 1910 to 2024. The dataset contains 338,199 records, each representing an object in space that has been monitored for its proximity to Earth.
#The Task:
Train a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a NEO is hazardous or not.
# The Processing:
First: Importing the dataset and cleaning it
Seconde: Exploratory Data Analysis and detect the trends
Third: The Data preprocessing by scaling the features and enoding the categrical and handling the imbalanced The technique that I used to handle it was SMOTE.
Fourth: Training the model:I trined two models (Decision tree, Logistic regression)
# The results:
The Decision tree give better results to predict the NEOs the accuarcy was approximately 91% Unlike the Logistic regression it was approximately 84%
And You can have a look to the code and see the full results with many metrics such as : confusion matrix, precision,recall,f1-score.
